/-- Differentiability in quadratic mean (DQM).

The model `M` is **DQM at `θ`** with score `ℓ : 𝓧 → Θ` w.r.t. the dominating measure `μ`
if the L²(μ) Hellinger residual is `o(‖h‖²)` as `h → 0`:
`∫ (√p_{θ+h} − √p_θ − ½⟨h, ℓ(x)⟩√p_θ)² dμ(x) = o(‖h‖²)`.

This is the central regularity condition of LAN (Local Asymptotic Normality);
see van der Vaart §7.2 (Eq. 7.1).

**Note on the conjunction.** In van der Vaart's definition the integral is the
Lebesgue integral of a non-negative function, where finiteness of the integral
is *the same as* `MemLp 2 μ`-membership of the residual.  When formalising with
Lean's Bochner integral `∫`, that equivalence breaks: a non-integrable
non-negative function has Bochner integral `0` by convention, so the
`o(‖h‖²)` rate condition is *trivially* satisfied for pathological models in
which the residual is never in `L²(μ)`.  We therefore record the implicit
"residual is eventually in `L²(μ)`" content of vdV's definition as a separate
conjunct (`mem`), so that our formal definition is *equivalent* to vdV's
informal one — no stronger, no weaker. -/
