# Random functions in a Donsker class (Lemma 19.24)

If `F` is a `P`-Donsker class of measurable functions and `f̂_n` is a
sequence of random functions taking values in `F` such that
`∫ (f̂_n − f₀)² dP →_P 0` for some `f₀ ∈ L²(P)`, then `G_n(f̂_n − f₀) →_P 0`
and hence `G_n f̂_n ⇝ G_P f₀`.

vdV §19.4 Lemma 19.24. vdV's proof uses the continuous-mapping theorem on
`ℓ^∞(F) × F → ℝ` together with Lemma 18.15 (almost all sample paths of the
limiting Gaussian process are continuous on `(F, ‖·‖_{P,2})`); the proof here
routes directly through the random-pair-in-probability form of
`IsAsymptoticallyEquicontinuous`, with no `ℓ^∞(F)`-topology infrastructure.

/-- **Lemma 19.24 (Random functions in a Donsker class)**.

Suppose `F` is a `P`-Donsker class of measurable functions and `f_hat n`
is a sequence of jointly measurable random functions taking values in
`F` such that `∫ (f_hat n − f₀)² dP →_P 0` for some `f₀ ∈ F` with
`f₀ ∈ L²(P)`. Then for every `η > 0`,
`μ{ξ | η < |G_n(f_hat n ξ) − G_n(f₀)|} → 0`,
i.e. `G_n(f_hat n) − G_n(f₀) →_P 0`.

vdV §19.4 Lemma 19.24.

Hypotheses:
* `h_donsker` — vdV §19.4 Theorem 19.24: `F` is `P`-Donsker.
* `_hf₀_in_F` — vdV §19.4: WLOG `f₀ ∈ F`.
* `_hf₀` — vdV §19.4: `f₀ ∈ L²(P)`.
* `h_range` — vdV §19.4: random functions take values in `F`.
* `h_l2_consistent` — vdV §19.4: the `→_P 0` of the L²(P)-distance
  hypothesis, expressed in expectation form (which is equivalent given
  the L² envelope of `F` and is more compact in Lean than the iterated
  `→_P` form).
* `hf₀_meas`, `h_fhat_meas` — joint measurability adapters required to
  apply equicontinuity at the random pair `(f_hat n, const f₀)`.
* `hX_*` — iid hypotheses on the sample (empirical-process setup).

**Proof.** The `IsAsymptoticallyEquicontinuous` predicate
(`Donsker.lean`) is in consumer form: it says that for any iid sample
and any pair of measurable random functions in `F` whose L²(P)-distance
squared has expectation tending to 0, the empirical process applied to
the difference tends to 0 in `μ`-probability. We apply this directly to
the pair `(f_hat n, fun _ => f₀)`. -/
