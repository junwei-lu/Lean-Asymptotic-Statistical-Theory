# Measurable selection for random functions in a function class

Theorem-agnostic API exposing the abstract closure-of-measurability
predicate `MeasurablySelectsRandomFunctions F` plus two consumer endpoints:

* `measurableSet_of_random_function_in_class` — given `hF`, the parameter-
  space event `{ξ | fhat ξ ∈ F}` is measurable.
* `exists_measurable_surrogate` — replace `fhat ξ` by a fixed `f₀ ∈ F`
  outside the membership event, preserving joint measurability.

The headline theorem `measurablySelectsRandomFunctions_of_l2_closed` proves
that every L²(P)-norm-closed admissible class measurably selects random
functions (Vaart–Wellner, *Weak Convergence and Empirical Processes*,
§2.10.1 Theorem 2.10.1), via the named sub-auxiliaries below.

closure step in the proof of Theorem 19.23).

/-- A class `F` of functions `Ω → ℝ` **measurably selects random functions**

random function `fhat : Ξ → (Ω → ℝ)` (joint measurability =
`Measurable (Function.uncurry fhat)`), the parameter-space event
`{ξ | fhat ξ ∈ F}` is measurable in `Ξ`.

This is the *abstract conclusion* of Vaart–Wellner Theorem 2.10.1, stripped
of its textbook hypotheses. The closure-of-measurability flavour is what
downstream lemmas actually consume; the textbook theorem
(`measurablySelectsRandomFunctions_of_l2_closed`, below) gives the
canonical sufficient hypothesis (L²(P)-norm-closed + admissibility).

We restrict `Ξ` to universe 0 (`Type`) to match the consuming
`IsAsymptoticallyEquicontinuous` definition. -/

/-! ## Vaart–Wellner Theorem 2.10.1 — structural decomposition

The content of V-W Thm 2.10.1 ("every L²(P)-norm-closed admissible
class measurably selects random functions") is factored into named
sub-auxiliary claims, each capturing a distinct mathematical piece of the
proof.

* `vw_polish_l2_space` — *L²(P) is Polish*: under
  `[MeasurableSpace.CountablyGenerated Ω]`, derived from the Mathlib
  `Lp.SecondCountableTopology` instance chain.

* `vw_random_function_to_l2_measurable` — packages the conclusion
  `MeasurableSet {ξ | fhat ξ ∈ F}`, delegating to
  `vw_l2_class_event_measurable` via the `Set.ext`+`hF_ae_invariant` bridge
  identifying the function-level event with the L²-class event.

* `vw_l2_class_event_measurable` — *L²-class event measurability*: the L²-
  side of V-W §2.10.1, stating that the L²-class event
  `{ξ | ∃ f ∈ F, fhat ξ =ᵃᵉ[P] f}` is `Ξ`-measurable.

* `vw_l2_closed_borel` — *closed L²-subset is Borel*. A norm-closed subset
  of `Lp ℝ 2 P` is Borel-measurable (via `IsClosed.measurableSet`).

* `vw_random_function_lp_lift_measurable` — *measurable lift* `Φ : Ξ → Lp ℝ 2 P`
  with measurable L²-locus `S ⊆ Ξ`.
  * `vw_random_function_lp_locus_measurable` — L²-locus
    measurability `S = {ξ | MemLp (fhat ξ) 2 P} ⊆ Ξ` via Fubini
    (`Measurable.lintegral_prod_right'`).
  * `vw_random_function_lp_lift_inner_measurable` — Lp-valued
    Borel-measurability of the canonical lift
    `Φ ξ := if h : MemLp (fhat ξ) 2 P then MemLp.toLp (fhat ξ) h else 0`,
    via `measurable_of_pointwise_dist_measurable` + per-`g` piecewise dist
    measurability.
  * `measurable_of_pointwise_dist_measurable` (ForMathlib helper) —
    *backwards companion to `Measurable.dist`*: in a second-countable Borel
    pseudo-metric target, pointwise dist measurability ⟹ Borel
    measurability, via `isOpen_sUnion_countable` ball cover.

* `vw_function_class_l2_image_closed` — *L²-image of `F` is closed in `Lp ℝ 2 P`*:
  the closure-transfer step from function-level L²-norm closedness of `F`
  (`hF_l2_closed`) to Lp-quotient closedness of the image, via
  `IsSeqClosed.isClosed` + `tendsto_Lp_iff_tendsto_eLpNorm'`.

The top-level theorem `measurablySelectsRandomFunctions_of_l2_closed`
assembles these via direct delegation to
`vw_random_function_to_l2_measurable`. -/

/-- **L²(P) is Polish / standard-Borel.**

The space `Lp ℝ 2 P` is a separable Banach space, hence Polish, when the
σ-algebra on `Ω` is countably generated. We expose the separability fragment
(`SecondCountableTopology`), which combined with `Lp`'s existing complete
metric structure yields the Polish space property used by the V-W §2.10.1
measurable-selection argument.

The proof assembles the Mathlib instance chain
`IsProbabilityMeasure P → IsFiniteMeasure → SigmaFinite → SFinite`
together with `[MeasurableSpace.CountablyGenerated Ω]` to derive
`[IsSeparable P]` and then `[Lp.SecondCountableTopology]` since `ℝ` is
separable.

`[MeasurableSpace.CountablyGenerated Ω]` is the standard textbook hypothesis
(vdV §19; V-W §2.10.1 takes the underlying sample space to be standard Borel
= Polish, which implies countably generated).

spaces where this is automatic). -/

/-- **L²-locus measurability** (V-W §2.10.1).

The L²-locus `S := {ξ | MemLp (fhat ξ) 2 P}` is `Ξ`-measurable when `fhat`
is jointly measurable.

Proof: unfold `MemLp` to `AEStronglyMeasurable ∧ eLpNorm < ∞`.
For real-valued `fhat`, each marginal `fhat ξ` is measurable (hence
strongly measurable since ℝ is second-countable), so the first conjunct
is automatic. For the second, rewrite `eLpNorm (fhat ξ) 2 P < ∞` as
`∫⁻ x, ‖fhat ξ x‖ₑ ^ 2 ∂P < ∞` (via `eLpNorm_nnreal_pow_eq_lintegral`) and
apply `Measurable.lintegral_prod_right'` to the jointly measurable
non-negative integrand.

/-- **ForMathlib helper — measurable from pointwise distance measurability.**

In a second-countable Borel pseudo-metric space `Y`, a function `f : X → Y`
from a measurable space `X` is measurable provided that for every `y : Y`
the real-valued function `x ↦ dist (f x) y` is `X`-measurable.

This is the backwards companion to `Measurable.dist` (the forward direction
gives dist measurability from measurability of both arguments). The
standard textbook fact used in the V-W §2.10.1 Lp-valued measurable-
selection argument: to show a candidate lift `Φ : Ξ → Lp ℝ 2 P` is Borel-
measurable, it suffices to check `ξ ↦ dist (Φ ξ) g` is `Ξ`-measurable for
every `g : Lp ℝ 2 P`.

**Proof**: in a metric space the open balls form a topological subbasis
for the topology, so any open set is a union of balls. By second-
countability (`isOpen_sUnion_countable`), the union can be taken countable.
Each ball preimage `f ⁻¹' Metric.ball y r = (dist (f ·) y) ⁻¹' Iio r` is
measurable from the pointwise dist hypothesis, and countable unions of
measurable sets are measurable. -/

/-- **Inner measurable lift** (V-W §2.10.1).

Given a jointly measurable random function `fhat : Ξ × Ω → ℝ`, there exists a
Borel-measurable lift `Φ : Ξ → Lp ℝ 2 P` such that on the L²-locus
`{ξ | MemLp (fhat ξ) 2 P}`, `Φ ξ = MemLp.toLp (fhat ξ) h`.

This is the deep content of V-W §2.10.1's measurable-selection argument: the
bridge from Ω-joint measurability of `fhat` to Lp-valued Borel-measurability
of the lifted family.

Construct

  `Φ ξ := if h : MemLp (fhat ξ) 2 P then MemLp.toLp (fhat ξ) h else 0`

(under `Classical.propDecidable`). `Lp ℝ 2 P` is separable Polish via
`vw_polish_l2_space` (Mathlib's `Lp.SecondCountableTopology` under
`[CountablyGenerated Ω]`); apply the helper
`measurable_of_pointwise_dist_measurable` and reduce to showing, for each
fixed `g : Lp ℝ 2 P`, that `ξ ↦ dist (Φ ξ) g` is `Ξ`-measurable.

Per-`g` measurability via a `Set.piecewise` split on the L²-locus
`S := {ξ | MemLp (fhat ξ) 2 P}` (via
`vw_random_function_lp_locus_measurable`):

* On `S`, `dist (Φ ξ) g = (eLpNorm (fhat ξ - ⇑g) 2 P).toReal`, expressible
  as `((∫⁻ x, ‖fhat ξ x - g x‖ₑ ^ 2 ∂P) ^ (1/2)).toReal`, measurable by
  `Measurable.lintegral_prod_right'` applied to the jointly measurable
  non-negative integrand `‖fhat ξ x - g x‖ₑ ^ 2`.
* On `Sᶜ`, `Φ ξ = 0`, so `dist (Φ ξ) g = ‖g‖` (constant).

/-- **Measurable lift** (V-W §2.10.1).

Given a jointly measurable random function `fhat : Ξ × Ω → ℝ`, there exists a
Borel-measurable lift `Φ : Ξ → Lp ℝ 2 P` together with a `Ξ`-measurable
L²-locus `S ⊆ Ξ` such that:

* `ξ ∈ S ↔ MemLp (fhat ξ) 2 P` (the L²-locus is the set of L² fibers);
* for every `ξ` and every proof `h : MemLp (fhat ξ) 2 P`,
  `Φ ξ = MemLp.toLp (fhat ξ) h` (so on the L²-locus the lift is the
  canonical L²-class of the fiber).

The body constructs the explicit witnesses

  `Φ ξ := if h : MemLp (fhat ξ) 2 P then MemLp.toLp (fhat ξ) h else 0`,
  `S := {ξ | MemLp (fhat ξ) 2 P}`

and delegates the three measurability/structural conjuncts to:

* `vw_random_function_lp_locus_measurable` — Fubini-style `S` measurability.
* `vw_random_function_lp_lift_inner_measurable` — `Φ` Borel-measurability
  via separable Polish + Fubini.

The `iff` and `eq` conjuncts are trivial (`rfl` and `dif_pos`).

/-- **L²-image of `F` is closed in `Lp ℝ 2 P`** (V-W §2.10.1).

The L²-image of an L²-norm-closed function class `F ⊆ L²(P)` is closed in
`Lp ℝ 2 P`. Specifically, given `hF_lp : F ⊆ L²(P)` and the function-level
closure hypothesis `hF_l2_closed`, the set

  F_lp := {g : Lp ℝ 2 P | ∃ (f : Ω → ℝ) (hf : f ∈ F),
                          g = MemLp.toLp f (hF_lp f hf)}

is closed in `Lp ℝ 2 P`.

This is the closure-transfer step from the function-level L²-norm
closedness of `F` (`hF_l2_closed`: any L²-Cauchy sequence in `F` has an
a.e. limit in `F`) to the Lp-quotient-level closedness of the image
`F_lp ⊆ Lp ℝ 2 P`.

Proof: sequential closedness. Extract representatives `fₙ ∈ F` of the Lp
sequence `gₙ`, convert Lp convergence to function-level
`∫ (fₙ - g_func)² ∂P → 0` via `MemLp.eLpNorm_eq_integral_rpow_norm` (plus
the L²-norm-squared formula `‖h‖² = ∫ h² ∂P`), apply `hF_l2_closed` to get
`f ∈ F` with `f =ᵃᵉ g_func`, then close via `MemLp.toLp_eq_toLp_iff` +
`Lp.toLp_coeFn`.

/-- **L²-class event measurability** (V-W §2.10.1).

Isolates the *L²-side* content of V-W Thm 2.10.1: given a jointly measurable
random function `fhat : Ξ × Ω → ℝ` and an L²-closed function class `F`, the
**L²-class event** `{ξ | ∃ f ∈ F, fhat ξ =ᵃᵉ[P] f}` is `Ξ`-measurable. This
event captures L²-membership up to a.e.-equality; the bridge to the
function-level event `{ξ | fhat ξ ∈ F}` is handled separately by the a.e.-
invariance hypothesis on the consumer side (see
`vw_random_function_to_l2_measurable`).

The body delegates to:

* `vw_random_function_lp_lift_measurable` — the measurable lift
  `Ξ → Lp ℝ 2 P` from joint measurability of `fhat`, with measurable
  L²-locus.
* `vw_function_class_l2_image_closed` — closure of the L²-image of `F` in
  `Lp ℝ 2 P` (closure transfer from the function-level `hF_l2_closed`).
* `vw_polish_l2_space` — supplies the Polish/standard-Borel structure on
  `Lp ℝ 2 P` via `[CountablyGenerated Ω]` (used implicitly through
  `borelize`).
* `vw_l2_closed_borel` — upgrades the closed L²-image to a Borel set, ready
  for `Measurable.preimage`.

The body assembles the four pieces via a `Set.ext` rewrite identifying the
L²-class event with the intersection `S ∩ Φ ⁻¹' F_lp`, then applies
`MeasurableSet.inter` and `Measurable.preimage`.

/-- **Joint measurability ⟹ measurable membership event** (V-W §2.10.1).

This packages the conclusion of V-W Theorem 2.10.1: given a jointly
measurable random function `fhat : Ξ × Ω → ℝ` and an L²-closed function
class `F` that is **closed under a.e. equality** (`hF_ae_invariant`, the
Vaart–Wellner §2.3 admissibility hypothesis), the function-level membership
event `{ξ | fhat ξ ∈ F}` is `Ξ`-measurable.

The body delegates to two pieces:

* `vw_l2_class_event_measurable` — measurability of the L²-class event
  `{ξ | ∃ f ∈ F, fhat ξ =ᵃᵉ[P] f}`.
* a `Set.ext` rewrite using `hF_ae_invariant` to identify the function-
  level event with the L²-class event; the admissibility hypothesis is
  exactly what makes the two events agree.

Hypotheses:

* `[MeasurableSpace.CountablyGenerated Ω]` — needed for `vw_polish_l2_space`
  to deliver the Polish structure on `Lp ℝ 2 P` (V-W §2.10.1 takes the
  underlying sample space to be standard Borel).
* `hF_ae_invariant` — `F` is invariant under a.e.-equality of P-functions;
  this is the V-W §2.3 admissibility content (every Donsker class is
  admissible — vdV §19.4).

functions*.

Every L²(P)-norm-closed admissible class `F` of L²(P)-integrable functions
measurably selects random functions: the parameter-space event
`{ξ | fhat ξ ∈ F}` is measurable for every jointly measurable
`fhat : Ξ → (Ω → ℝ)`.

**Hypotheses** (matching Vaart–Wellner §2.10.1):

* `hF_lp` — `F ⊆ L²(P)`: every `f ∈ F` is L²(P)-integrable.
* `hF_l2_closed` — the image of `F` in `Lp ℝ 2 P` under the canonical
  L²-class map is closed (norm-closed in `Lp ℝ 2 P`).
* `hF_ae_invariant` — `F` is closed under a.e. equality of P-functions
  (V-W §2.3 admissibility; every Donsker class is admissible, vdV §19.4).
* `[MeasurableSpace.CountablyGenerated Ω]` — the underlying sample space
  is countably generated (V-W §2.10.1's standard-Borel setup), used to
  derive separability of `Lp ℝ 2 P`.

The content is factored into named sub-auxes:

* `vw_polish_l2_space` — Polish structure on L²(P) under
  `[CountablyGenerated Ω]`.
* `vw_random_function_to_l2_measurable` — bridges the function-level event
  to the L²-class event via `hF_ae_invariant`.
* `vw_l2_class_event_measurable` — the L²-side content packaged as
  `MeasurableSet {ξ | ∃ f ∈ F, fhat ξ =ᵃᵉ[P] f}`.
* `vw_l2_closed_borel` — closed ⟹ Borel.

The top-level body delegates to `vw_random_function_to_l2_measurable`,
which in turn delegates to `vw_l2_class_event_measurable`.
