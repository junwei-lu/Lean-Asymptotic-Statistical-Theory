# Measurable selection of approximate ε-minimisers

Measurable selection of approximate ε-minimisers from a jointly measurable
function on a Polish target space, via the Aumann / Jankov-von Neumann
construction. The pieces are theorem-agnostic and reusable:

* `analytic_projection_aeMeasurable` — analytic projection of a Borel
  level set is m-a.e. measurable (Suslin / Choquet capacitability).
* `exists_measurable_approx_argmin` — abstract ε-approximate argmin
  selector for a jointly measurable `f : α × β → ℝ≥0∞` on Polish `β`.
* `exists_measurable_approx_argmin_lintegral` — entry-point form
  specialised to the Bayes-risk integrand
  `(x, b) ↦ ∫⁻ θ, ℓ θ b ∂(posterior x)`.

The construction uses standard-Borel structure on Polish `β` plus
Aumann-style projection measurability; it does NOT depend on lower
semicontinuity of `ℓ` in the second factor.

/-- **Sub-lemma 1 — analytic projection is m-a.e. measurable**.

For `f : α × β → ℝ≥0∞` jointly measurable on a Polish-target second factor,
the level-set projection `{x : α | ∃ b : β, f (x, b) < c}` corresponds to an
analytic set in α. Under σ-finite m, the projection is m-a.e. measurable
via Choquet capacitability of analytic sets (Suslin's theorem).

Concretely: for fixed `c : ℝ≥0∞`, the projection is the image of the Borel
set `{(x, b) | f (x, b) < c}` under the Borel projection `α × β → α`.
Mathlib's `MeasurableSet.analyticSet_image` plus Choquet capacitability
give this projection's m-a.e. measurability.

The hypotheses:
- `f`, `c`, `m` — the integrand, threshold, and σ-finite measure (vdV §8.5).
- `hf` — joint measurability of the integrand.
- `[StandardBorelSpace α]` — needed for `MeasurableSet.analyticSet_image`
  (the source-space hypothesis in Mathlib's API). Polish ⇒ standard-Borel
  is automatic on the consumer site.
- `[TopologicalSpace β] [PolishSpace β] [BorelSpace β]` — Polish
  target gives second-countable Borel structure required by the analytic-image
  theorem.
- `[SFinite m]` — regularity for the null-measurable conclusion.

Proof: via `MeasurableSet.analyticSet_image` and Suslin's theorem
(`AnalyticSet.measurableSet_of_compl`), composed with σ-finite `m` to get
m-a.e. measurability of the projection. -/

/-- **Borel-measurability of the ε-argmin graph**.

For jointly measurable `f : α × β → ℝ≥0∞` on standard-Borel α and a
Polish-target β, and `ε > 0`, the graph
`G := {(x, b) | f (x, b) ≤ (⨅ b', f (x, b')) + ε}`
is **null-measurable** in the product σ-algebra of `α × β` w.r.t. any
σ-finite measure on `α`.

Why null-measurable, not Borel-measurable: φ x := ⨅ b', f (x, b') is
only **m-a.e.**-measurable in α (`analytic_projection_aeMeasurable`):
its level sets are analytic, and Choquet capacitability gives only
universal measurability, not Borel measurability.

Sketch: write `G = (f).preimage(level)` ∩ `(φ ∘ Prod.fst).preimage(level)`.
Both factors are jointly null-measurable once φ is m-a.e.-measurable on α;
the intersection is null-measurable on α × β.

The proof reduces null-measurability of the graph to (i) a.e.-measurability
of `φ x := ⨅ b', f (x, b')` on `m`, obtained from
`analytic_projection_aeMeasurable` plus
`ENNReal.aemeasurable_of_exist_almost_disjoint_supersets`, and (ii) the
fact that the graph defined with the measurable representative
`φ' := AEMeasurable.mk φ` is Borel-measurable, while the difference with
the original graph lies in the **vertical strip** `N × β` with
`N := {x | φ x ≠ φ' x}` an m-null set.

The output is a Borel representative `G' : Set (α × β)` and an m-null
witness `N : Set α` such that on the m-conull complement `Nᶜ`, the fibers of
the original graph and `G'` coincide. -/

/-- **Cauchy nested-ball selector core** (inner step).

The recursive index construction for the closed-graph Aumann selector. Given a
metric Polish target `β` and a Borel graph `F ⊆ α × β` with non-empty fibers
off an m-null set `N`, this lemma produces:

* a measurable sequence `b : ℕ → α → β` taking values in the dense range
  `Set.range (TopologicalSpace.denseSeq β)`,
* a measurable m-null superset `N₀ ⊇ N`,

such that off `N₀`, the sequence `b k x` is Cauchy with successive distances
controlled by `2^{-k}`, and each ball `closedBall (b k x) 2^{-k}` meets the
fiber `F_x := {b : β | (x, b) ∈ F}`.

**Construction**: by recursion on `k`. At level 0, take any dense point witnessing
non-emptiness of `F_x` (m-a.e.). At level `k+1`, refine: pick the least
`u (idx i)` of the dense sequence that lies in `closedBall (b k x) 2^{-k}` AND
whose `2^{-(k+1)}`-ball still meets `F_x`. The latter predicate is
null-measurable via `nullMeasurableSet_proj_of_borel_basis` (the basis-ball
preimage). `Nat.find` packages the choice measurably; the null sets accumulate
across levels into one measurable witness.

This is the recursive null-set bookkeeping (`MeasureTheory.toMeasurable` +
`Nat.find` measurability + per-level null-superset extraction), separated from
the limit argument that closes the outer `aumann_selector_closed_graph_polish`. -/

/-- **Closed-graph Cauchy selector core**.

The Cauchy nested-ball construction at the heart of the Jankov-von Neumann /
Aumann measurable selection theorem, specialised to the case where the graph
`F` is **closed** (not just Borel) in `α × β` with respect to a given Polish
topology on `β`. Given non-empty fibers off an m-null set `N`, this lemma
produces a measurable selector `s : α → β` with `(x, s x) ∈ F` for every
`x` outside a measurable m-null superset `N₀ ⊇ N`.

**Construction (Kechris §18.A nested-ball Cauchy)**:
the recursive index construction is lifted as `cauchy_selector_inductive_step`
(above). The body of this lemma is the limit + closedness argument: extract
the Cauchy sequence from the sub-step, take its limit via metric completeness,
and use `IsClosed F` to conclude that the limit `(x, s x)` lies in `F`.

The hypotheses:
- `F`, `m`, `N`, `hF_closed`, `hN_meas`, `hN_null`, `hF_ne_offN` —
  closed Borel graph in `α × β` plus per-x non-emptiness off `N`.
- structural typeclasses: `α` and `β` are both Polish with the
  Borel measurable structure (so `IsClosed F` is well-formed and Borel
  measurability of the constructed selector is meaningful). -/

/-! ### Single-space refinement on α × β

Closing an arbitrary Borel graph cannot be done by *factor-wise* Polish
refinement (a Cantor off-diagonal counter-example obstructs it). The approach
here refines the topology on the **product** `α × β` directly as a single
Polish space, lifts the closed-graph Aumann selector inside that refined
topology, then projects back to `α` via an m.a.e. fiber identity.

The chain consists of:

* `polishRefinement_of_measurable_singleSpace` — single-space Polish
  refinement on `α × β` making a Borel set `G'` clopen, plus Borel-σ-algebra
  preservation. Direct adapter to Mathlib's `MeasurableSet.isClopenable`.
* `aumann_suslin_scheme_cauchy` — outer wrapper, composing the
  single-space refinement with the closed-graph selector and the fiber identity.
* `aumann_selector_closed_graph_polish_singleSpace` — closed-graph
  Aumann selection where the **graph lives in α × γ** and γ = α × β is
  treated as a single Polish target, with **m.a.e. fiber identity** on
  the first coordinate.
* `cauchy_selector_inductive_step_singleSpace` — inner nested-ball
  recursion when the target is a single Polish space γ (no factor split).
* `proj_identity_mae_of_closed_graph` — given a measurable selector
  `t : α → α × β` whose graph lies in a closed graph `Ĝ ⊆ α × (α × β)`
  whose fibers over `x ∈ α` are contained in `{x} × β`, the
  first-coordinate projection `(t x).1 = x` holds m-a.e.
* `nullMeasurableSet_image_fst_of_borel` — analytic-projection bridge:
  `Prod.fst '' G'` is null-measurable in α for Borel `G' ⊆ α × β`
  (specialisation of `analyticSet_image` + Choquet).
* `coordProj_snd_measurable_singleSpace` — second-coordinate-projection
  measurability: the second factor of a measurable map into `α × β` is
  itself measurable.

The supporting facts: `MeasurableSet.isClopenable` works on a single Polish
space (no factor structure needed); the m.a.e. fiber identity is provable from
analytic-set bookkeeping; and the first-coordinate projection of a measurable
map into `α × β` remains measurable, so the `α → β` selector falls out by
composing `t : α → α × β` with `Prod.snd`.
-/

/-- **Single-space Polish refinement closing a Borel graph**.

Given a Borel set `G' ⊆ α × β` (both α and β Polish, with their Borel
σ-algebras), there exists a Polish topology `τ'` on **the product** `α × β`
(treated as a single space) such that:

* `τ'` is finer than the original product topology `tα.prod tβ`;
* The Borel σ-algebra under `τ'` coincides with the original product
  measurable structure on `α × β`;
* `G'` is **clopen** under `τ'`.

This is the direct adapter of Mathlib's `MeasurableSet.isClopenable`
applied to the single Polish space `α × β` (Polish-product is Polish
automatically; product `BorelSpace` instance is auto-derived in Mathlib).

Doing this **factor-wise** would be false for arbitrary Borel `G'` (Cantor
off-diagonal counter-example). The single-space version is correct via
`MeasurableSet.isClopenable` directly.

The hypotheses:
- `G'`, `hG'_meas` — the Borel graph and its measurability.
- structural typeclasses on `α` and `β` (Polish + Borel) —
  needed for the Polish-product instance and to invoke `MeasurableSet.isClopenable`. -/

/-- **Cauchy nested-ball selector for a single Polish target γ**.

The single-space analogue of `cauchy_selector_inductive_step`. Given a Borel
graph `Ĝ ⊆ α × γ` whose fibers over `α \ N` are non-empty, this produces:
* a measurable sequence `b : ℕ → α → γ` taking values in the dense range
  of `denseSeq γ`,
* a measurable m-null superset `N₀ ⊇ N`,

such that off `N₀`, the sequence `b k x` is Cauchy with successive distances
controlled by `2^{-k}`, and each ball `closedBall (b k x) 2^{-k}` meets the
fiber `Ĝ_x := {c : γ | (x, c) ∈ Ĝ}`.

Difference from `cauchy_selector_inductive_step`: the target type `γ` is
a single Polish space (no factor split), and the resulting selector takes
values in `γ` (e.g. `α × β` when γ = α × β).

/-- **Closed-graph Aumann selector for a single Polish target γ with
m.a.e. fiber identity**.

Given a Borel graph `Ĝ ⊆ α × γ` that is **closed** in a Polish refinement on
γ, with non-empty fibers over `α \ N`, produces a measurable selector
`t : α → γ` and a measurable m-null exceptional set `N₀ ⊇ N` such that
`(x, t x) ∈ Ĝ` for every `x ∉ N₀`.

Specialisation: when `γ = α × β` and the graph `Ĝ` encodes a "lifted" Borel
set `G' ⊆ α × β` via `Ĝ := {(x, (y, b)) | x = y ∧ (y, b) ∈ G'}`, the resulting
selector `t : α → α × β` satisfies `(t x).1 = x` m-a.e. (by
`proj_identity_mae_of_closed_graph`) and `(t x).2 ∈ G'_x` m-a.e. (by composing
this conclusion with the fiber projection). The closed-graph hypothesis
`hĜ_closed` is supplied by `polishRefinement_of_measurable_singleSpace`.

The hypotheses:
- `Ĝ`, `m`, `N`, `hĜ_meas`, `hĜ_closed`, `hN_meas`, `hN_null`,
  `hĜ_ne_offN` — the closed graph in single-space γ, measure, m-null
  exceptional set, and per-x non-emptiness.
- structural typeclasses: `α` Polish + Borel; `γ` Polish +
  Borel + Nonempty + MetricSpace (the metric is required for the
  Cauchy nested-ball construction). -/

/-- **m.a.e. fiber identity from a graph with diagonal-fibered structure**.

Given:
* a measurable selector `t : α → α × β`,
* a Borel set `Ĝ ⊆ α × (α × β)` (with `[StandardBorelSpace α]` + Polish β)
  whose fiber over each `x ∈ α` is contained in the *singleton-prefix slice*
  `{x} × β` (i.e. `(x, (y, b)) ∈ Ĝ ⇒ y = x`),
* `(x, t x) ∈ Ĝ` for `x ∉` an m-null set,

the first-coordinate projection `(t x).1 = x` holds m-a.e.

**Proof**: pointwise on the m-conull set `{x | (x, t x) ∈ Ĝ}` (witnessed by
`hĜ_t_ae`), `hĜ_diag` applied at `(x, t x)` yields `(t x).1 = x`. The
diagonal-fiber containment is supplied by the caller's construction of `Ĝ`
(e.g. `Ĝ := {(x, (y, b)) | x = y ∧ (y, b) ∈ G'}`), so no analytic-image
bookkeeping is needed at this lemma.

Composing `aumann_selector_closed_graph_polish_singleSpace` with this lemma
gives a selector `α → β` (the form expected by
`aumann_measurable_selection_of_borel_graph_minus_null`): extract
`Prod.snd ∘ t : α → β` (`coordProj_snd_measurable_singleSpace`) and the m.a.e.
fiber identity gives `(x, (Prod.snd ∘ t) x) ∈ G'` m-a.e.

The hypotheses:
- `Ĝ`, `t`, `ht_meas`, `hĜ_diag`, `hĜ_t_ae` — the lifted graph,
  selector, its measurability, the diagonal-fiber containment, and the
  selector-membership m.a.e. property.

/-- **Suslin-scheme Cauchy sequence**.

Internal recursive construction supporting `aumann_measurable_selection_of_borel_graph_minus_null`.
For each Borel set `G' ⊆ α × β` with a Polish target `β`, this lemma exposes a
measurable selector `s : α → β` and a measurable m-null exceptional set `N₀ ⊇ N`
such that on `N₀ᶜ` the pointwise conclusion `(x, s x) ∈ G'` holds.

**Subtlety (Borel-not-just-closed `G'`)**: a naive Cauchy-limit argument only
produces a selector in `closure(G'_x)`, not in `G'_x`. The Kechris (§18.A) fix
uses a Polish refinement of the topology on the product `α × β` (treated as
a single Polish space via `MeasurableSet.isClopenable`) so that `G'` becomes
**closed** in the refined topology; then the closed-graph Cauchy construction
(via `aumann_selector_closed_graph_polish_singleSpace`) applies. Borel
structures under the refined topology coincide with the original
(`borel_eq_borel_of_le`), so the selector is measurable in the original Borel
sense as well.

The body delegates to the single-space Polish refinement chain:

- `polishRefinement_of_measurable_singleSpace`: Polish refinement on
  the product `α × β` directly (single space), making `G'` clopen.
- `aumann_selector_closed_graph_polish_singleSpace`: closed-graph
  selector on the lifted graph `Ĝ ⊆ α × (α × β)`, returning `t : α → α × β`.
- `proj_identity_mae_of_closed_graph`: m.a.e. fiber identity
  `(t x).1 = x` from the diagonal-fibered structure of `Ĝ`.
- `coordProj_snd_measurable_singleSpace`: extract `s := fun x => (t x).2`
  measurably.
- `nullMeasurableSet_image_fst_of_borel`: null-measurability of
  the first projection used in the analytic-image bookkeeping.

The hypotheses:
- `G'`, `m`, `N`, `hG'_meas`, `hN_meas`, `hN_null`, `hΓ_ne_offN` —
  same shape as the wrapper.
- structural typeclasses inherited from the wrapper. -/

/-- **Measurable selection from a Borel multifunction**.

Given a Borel set `G' ⊆ α × β` whose vertical fibers `G'_x := {b | (x, b) ∈ G'}`
are non-empty for every `x` (using `[Nonempty β]` on the empty fibers as
fallback if a m-null exception set is allowed), produces a **measurable**
selector `s : α → β` with `(x, s x) ∈ G'` for every `x` outside an m-null
exceptional set.

This is the standard Jankov-von Neumann measurable selection theorem on the
**Borel-graph form** (Bogachev *Measure Theory* Vol. II, Theorem 6.9.6;
Aliprantis-Border *Infinite Dimensional Analysis*, Theorem 18.19; Kechris,
*Classical Descriptive Set Theory*, §18). The "m-a.e." weakening (rather
than everywhere) is the universally-measurable version one gets from
Choquet capacitability of analytic sets via
`MeasureTheory.AnalyticSet.nullMeasurableSet`.

The input is a Borel `G'` plus an m-null `N`: a `(m.prod dirac)`-null
hypothesis would only constrain the default-β slice of the graph, not the
whole graph (a Vitali counter-example shows the original graph can be highly
non-measurable while satisfying it). Instead the input takes the
**vertical-strip null** form (a Borel representative `G'` and an m-null
exceptional set `N` such that on `Nᶜ`, the original graph and `G'` agree
fiber-wise), and JvN selection operates on the Borel set `G'` directly.

The hypotheses:
- `G'`, `m`, `N`, `hG'_meas`, `hN_meas`, `hN_null`, `hΓ_ne_offN` —
  the Borel graph, reference measure, m-null exceptional set, and
  per-x non-emptiness condition off the exceptional set.
- `[StandardBorelSpace α]` — Suslin/Choquet analytic-projection
  hypothesis (matches `MeasurableSet.analyticSet_image`'s source).
- `[TopologicalSpace β] [PolishSpace β] [BorelSpace β]
  [Nonempty β]` — Polish + Nonempty target for the countable-basis
  Suslin scheme + default fallback on the m-null residual.
- `[SFinite m]` — regularity for the m-a.e. conclusion.

The proof delegates to the Suslin-scheme sub-lemma `aumann_suslin_scheme_cauchy`
above, which carries the recursive measurable construction that produces the
selector + a measurable m-null witness `N₀ ⊇ N`. -/

/-- **Sub-lemma 2 — ε-approximate argmin selector**.

Given a jointly measurable `f : α × β → ℝ≥0∞` on Polish-target `β` and
`ε > 0`, construct a **measurable** function `s : α → β` such that
`f (x, s x) ≤ (⨅ b, f (x, b)) + ε` for **m-a.e.** `x`.

**Strategy (Aumann/Jankov-von Neumann)**: define the multifunction
`Γ x := {b : β | f (x, b) ≤ (⨅ b', f (x, b')) + ε}`. Two ingredients:

1. **`Γ x ≠ ∅` for every `x`**. If `⨅ b', f (x, b') = ∞` then any
   `b ∈ β` (using `[Nonempty β]`) satisfies the bound trivially. If
   `⨅ b', f (x, b') < ∞` then by definition of `iInf` and `ε > 0`
   there is a `b` with `f (x, b) ≤ ⨅ b', f (x, b') + ε`.
2. **Graph of `Γ` is null-measurable** in `α × β` (w.r.t. the product
   `m × Measure.dirac default`). The graph is
   `{(x, b) : f (x, b) ≤ φ x + ε}` where `φ x := ⨅ b', f (x, b')`. The
   graph is the preimage of the closed set `{(u, v) : u ≤ v + ε}`
   under the jointly null-measurable map `(x, b) ↦ (f (x, b), φ x)`.
   Joint measurability of `f` is given; m-a.e.-measurability of `φ`
   is `analytic_projection_aeMeasurable` via Choquet
   capacitability of analytic projections. The graph's
   null-measurability is `nullMeasurableSet_approx_argmin_graph` above.

JvN selection (the `aumann_measurable_selection_of_borel_graph_minus_null`
core) then yields a measurable `s : α → β` with `s x ∈ Γ x` m-a.e., i.e.
exactly the claimed bound m-a.e. The "null-measurable graph" form is
sufficient for the m-a.e. selector conclusion (vs the "analytic graph" form,
which requires choosing a Polish topology on `α` via `upgradeStandardBorel α`).

**Why a dense-seq partition fails**: take `β = ℝ`, `f x b := 𝟙[b ≠ 0]` (so
`⨅_b f (x, b) = 0` but `f (x, b_n) = 1` whenever `b_n ≠ 0`). For `ε < 1`,
the candidate sets `A_n := {x | f (x, b_n) ≤ ⨅ + ε} = ∅`, so the
union doesn't cover `α`. The dense-seq partition tacitly assumes
`f` is lower semicontinuous in `b` (so `denseSeq` could attain the
infimum to within ε); without this, the ε-slack alone is **not** enough,
and Aumann/JvN's analytic-graph selection is the correct tool.

The hypotheses:
- `f`, `m`, `ε`, `hε` — the integrand, σ-finite reference
  measure, approximation slack.
- `hf` — joint measurability of the integrand.
- `[StandardBorelSpace α]` — analytic projection on the source side.
- `[TopologicalSpace β] [PolishSpace β] [BorelSpace β]
  [Nonempty β]` — Polish + Nonempty target so JvN's countable-basis
  Suslin scheme applies and a default fallback exists on the m-null
  residual.
- `[SFinite m]` — regularity for the m-a.e. conclusion.

The proof delegates to two helpers above:
- `nullMeasurableSet_approx_argmin_graph` — vertical-strip null structure
  of the graph.
- `aumann_measurable_selection_of_borel_graph_minus_null` — the JvN core
  on the Borel-graph form. -/

/-- **Sub-lemma 3 (entry-point) — Bayes-risk ε-approximate selector**.

The form consumed by `bayesRisk_le_lintegral_iInf_minRisk_selector`.
Specialises `exists_measurable_approx_argmin` to the joint integrand
`(x, b) ↦ ∫⁻ θ, ℓ θ b ∂(posterior x)` on a Polish 𝓨 target (e.g.
`EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin d)`, Polish via metric + second-countable instances).

The `∫⁻ x ∂m, ⨅_b ... + ε` bound follows from the a.e. bound of
`exists_measurable_approx_argmin` plus `lintegral_mono_ae` + `lintegral_const`.
The `m univ = 0` corner case gives the bound trivially via `ENNReal.le_add_right`.

The hypotheses:
- `ℓ`, `posterior`, `m`, `ε`, `hε` — standard Bayes-risk data
  (loss, posterior disintegration kernel, data marginal, slack).
- `hℓ` — joint measurability of the loss `(θ, b) ↦ ℓ θ b` (vdV §8.5).
- `[StandardBorelSpace 𝓧]` — required for analytic projection on the
  data-space side; `EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin n)` (or a product of Polish
  spaces) is standard-Borel automatically.
- `[TopologicalSpace 𝓨] [PolishSpace 𝓨] [BorelSpace 𝓨] [Nonempty 𝓨]`
  — Polish + Nonempty estimator-space target.
- `[IsSFiniteKernel posterior]`, `[IsFiniteMeasure m]` — regularity.
  `[IsFiniteMeasure m]` auto-derives `[SFinite m]` via
  `IsFiniteMeasure.toSigmaFinite`. The conclusion `+ ε` requires
  `m univ < ∞` so the slack `ε' := ε / (m univ + 1)` satisfies
  `ε' * m univ ≤ ε`; under `[SFinite m]` alone `m univ` can be `∞`,
  breaking absorption. A probability measure (the typical consumer) satisfies
  `[IsFiniteMeasure m]` automatically.

Proof: compose the above:
1. Define `φ (x, b) := ∫⁻ θ, ℓ θ b ∂(posterior x)`.
2. Prove `φ` jointly measurable via `Measurable.lintegral_kernel_prod_right'`
   on the comapped kernel `posterior.comap Prod.fst measurable_fst`.
3. Apply `exists_measurable_approx_argmin` to `φ` with slack
   `ε' := (ε : ℝ≥0∞) / (m univ + 1)`.
4. Conclude the lintegral bound from the a.e. bound via `lintegral_mono_ae`,
   `lintegral_add_right`, `lintegral_const`, plus arithmetic. -/
