# Prohorov-type tightness and subsequence extraction on probability measures

Two Prohorov-flavoured results used in van der Vaart §7.10 ("marginal tight ⇒ joint
tight, then pick a weak-convergent subsequence"):

* `tight_prod_of_tight_marginals` — tight marginals ⇒ tight joint;
* `extract_weak_subseq` — in a Polish space, a tight sequence of probability measures
  admits a weakly convergent subsequence (via Mathlib's
  `isCompact_closure_of_isTightMeasureSet` + metrizability of `ProbabilityMeasure`).

Plus the convenience rewriting `isTightMeasureSet_range_iff_singleton_tight`.

/-- **Marginals tight ⇒ joint tight** (on a product of two spaces).

Given a set `S` of probability measures on `X × Y` whose first-marginal and
second-marginal projections are each tight, `S` itself is tight. Standard argument:
cover each marginal by a compact up to `ε/2`; the product of those compacts covers
the joint up to `ε` (the complement is the union of two "strips", each controlled by
its marginal). -/

/-- **Weak convergence implies tightness of the range** (Prohorov converse, sequence form).

If a sequence of probability measures `μ n` on a Polish space converges weakly to a
probability measure `ν`, then the set `{μ n | n ∈ ℕ}` is tight.

Proof: lift to `ProbabilityMeasure`, get `Tendsto` in the weak topology, observe that
`insert Pν (Set.range P)` is compact (convergent sequence + limit), take the closure
(closed subset of compact = compact), and apply Mathlib's
`isTightMeasureSet_of_isCompact_closure`. -/

/-- **Prohorov: tight ⇒ sequentially compact for weak convergence** (Polish case).

If the range `{μ n | n : ℕ}` is a tight set of probability measures on a Polish space
`E`, there exists a strictly monotone subsequence extractor `φ` and a probability measure
`μ_lim` such that `μ (φ k)` converges weakly to `μ_lim`.

Proof: lift `μ n` to `ProbabilityMeasure E`; the range is tight, so its closure is
compact (Mathlib `isCompact_closure_of_isTightMeasureSet`). `ProbabilityMeasure E` is
metrizable for Polish `E`, hence first-countable, so the compact closure is sequentially
compact; extract a subsequence converging in the weak topology. Translate back to our
test-function-based `WeakConverges` via `ProbabilityMeasure.tendsto_iff_forall_integral_tendsto`. -/
