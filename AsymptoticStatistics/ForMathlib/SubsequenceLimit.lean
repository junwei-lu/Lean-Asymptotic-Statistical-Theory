Subsequence limit uniqueness: if every subsequence of `x` has a sub-subsequence
converging to `x_lim`, then the full sequence converges to `x_lim`.

This is the "Urysohn-type" lemma used in van der Vaart §7.10 Step 8 to promote a
subsequence weak limit (extracted via Prohorov) to a full-sequence weak limit.

Pure topology, theorem-agnostic; it is a thin wrapper around Mathlib's
`Filter.tendsto_of_subseq_tendsto`, specialised to strictly monotone subsequences
(which is the form produced by Prohorov-style extractions).

/-- **Urysohn subsequence principle (StrictMono form).** If every strictly monotone
subsequence of `x : ℕ → X` admits a further strictly monotone sub-subsequence whose
composite converges to `x_lim`, then the full sequence `x` converges to `x_lim`.

Proof: reduce to `Filter.tendsto_of_subseq_tendsto` by extracting a strictly monotone
sub-sequence from any `ns : ℕ → ℕ` tending to `atTop`
(via `Filter.strictMono_subseq_of_tendsto_atTop`), then apply the hypothesis to it. -/
